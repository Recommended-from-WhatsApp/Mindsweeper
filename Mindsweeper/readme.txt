{by James Jiang}

Mindsweeper is a BETTER version of the OG Minesweeper.

Features include:
- All GENERATED boards (of any difficulty) are 100% solvable using logic
- 3 Built-in difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard) that really gets harder
- AI Move button, behind which there is an AI who thinks just like you but never makes silly mistakes ;]
- New Game button, which literally wipes the board clean and GENERATES a new one
- Reset button, which allows the player to retry the exact same board they failed on (or compete with a friend)
- A completion time in seconds shown to 2 decimal places upon winning the game (in any difficulty)
- All original Minesweeper features such as flags and automine

In this adaptation of Minesweeper, chances and probabilities are the least of your worries!
Whether you're a beginner learning the game or a veteran sharpening his skills, this is the perfect version of the game for you!
